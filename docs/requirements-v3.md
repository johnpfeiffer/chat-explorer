# Goal

Directly support opening a .zip file (much easier for the user to not have to unzip and see all the files)

example: data-2026-12-25-01-02-04-batch-0000.zip

- conversations.json
- memories.json
- projects.json

for MVP please only focus on conversations.json


ignore for now:

memories.json
{"conversations_memory": 
"project_memories": {"01983b27-f4ca-75b5-a0b6-1234":

projects.json
[{"uuid": "019830a1-4e86-734d-bd8b-9f8e3a6b2dc6", "name": "
"description":
"is_private"
"created_at"
