# Feature - enhanced details

Ensure the UI displays for each conversation:
- conversation name
- message count
- last-load time
- any error alerts

preserve conversation order
if for some reason the speaker is unknown mark as "unknown"

Display each message timestamp (in the local timezone with an indication like "Pacific", only to the second) besides the speaker's name

## Improved Design

Use Material-UI
Make the application "light mode" with a "Minimalist" design

Start conversations collapsed by default - allow the User to expand a conversation
- the symbol to expan should be + , and the symbol to collapse should be -
