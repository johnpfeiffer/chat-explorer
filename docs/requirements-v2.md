# Feature - enhanced details

Ensure the UI displays for each conversation:
- conversation name
- message count
- last-load time
- any error alerts

preserve conversation order
if for some reason the speaker is unknown mark as "unknown"

## Improved Design

Use Material-UI
Make the application "light mode" with a "Minimalist" design

Start conversations collapsed by default - allow the User to expand a conversation
